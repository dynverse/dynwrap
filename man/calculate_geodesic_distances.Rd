\title{Calculate geodesic distances between cells in a trajectory}
\usage{
calculate_geodesic_distances(trajectory, waypoint_cells = NULL,
  waypoint_milestone_percentages = NULL, directed = FALSE)

compute_tented_geodesic_distances(trajectory, waypoint_cells = NULL,
  waypoint_milestone_percentages = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{trajectory}{The trajectory as created by \code{\link[=infer_trajectory]{infer_trajectory()}} or \code{\link[=add_trajectory]{add_trajectory()}}}

\item{waypoint_cells}{A vector of waypoint cells. Only the geodesic distances between waypoint cells and all other cells will be calculated.}

\item{waypoint_milestone_percentages}{The milestone percentages of non-cell waypoints, containing waypoint_id, milestone_id and percentage columns}

\item{directed}{Take into account the directions of the milestone edges. The cells that cannot be reached from a particular waypoint will have distance infinity.}
}
\description{
Will calculate geodesic distances between cells within a trajectory. To speed things up, only the distances with a set of waypoint cells are calculated.
}
\details{
The geodesic distance takes into account the length of an edge regions of delayed commitment.
